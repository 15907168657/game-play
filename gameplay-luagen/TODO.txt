Unsupported:
============
- operators
- templates
- variable arguments
- Lua doesn't support as many types as C++ so if there are functions that overload on parameters with types that overlap in Lua, the overloading won't work properly (i.e. char, short, int, long, float, double and all corresponding unsigned variants overlap in Lua).

Normal Priority List:
=====================
- Add support for object arrays (i.e. VertexElement*).
- Add "@script{create}" to the appropriate gameplay functions.
- Fix memory leaks in gameplay-luagen and in generated code.

- Add support for passing function pointers (i.e. for material parameter binding) (using the same string mechanism that was used for enums?).
- Add support for function callback parameters using Lua functions (i.e. scene->visit("myLuaFunction")).
- Add support for touch/key/mouse event callbacks.
- Add support for listener callbacks.

Low Priority List:
==================
- Add support for std::vector.
- Separate threads?
